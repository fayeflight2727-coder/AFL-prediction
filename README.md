## Project Overview
This repository contains the code, analysis, and documentation for our Enterprise Data Science & Machine Learning in Production (INSY674) project. We built an **explainable machine learning system** to predict goal-scoring probability for AFL players, transforming over a century of historical sports data into a strategic decision-support tool for coaching departments.

**Core Value Proposition:** Professional sports are high-stakes enterprises. AFL teams invest millions, yet critical match strategies often rely on intuition rather than empirical evidence. Our solution helps the Coaching Department make better decisions by providing data-backed predictions. This isn't just a scoreboard forecast; it's a decision-support system to understand opponent weaknesses and optimize team selection.

## Business Challenge & Solution

### The Challenge
- **High-Stakes Decisions:** AFL teams make multi-million dollar decisions on player selection, strategy, and recruitment with limited empirical backing.
- **Data Underutilization:** While vast historical data exists, it remains siloed and not systematically analyzed for predictive insights.
- **Intuition vs. Evidence:** Coaches and selectors often rely on experience over data-driven probability, potentially missing key performance indicators.

### Our Solution
We developed a **two-part analytics engine**:

1. **Predictive Model** *(located in `/models` folder)*: A machine learning system that predicts goal-scoring probability for individual players based on their attributes and game context, with full explainability via SHAP.
2. **Causal Inference Model** *(located in `/models` folder)*: Tests hypotheses about *why* performance happens—understanding the causal impact of physical attributes (height, weight, BMI) and rule changes on player performance across positions.

## Predictive Model (in /models folder)

### Model Architecture
We are developing a **stacked ensemble model** that combines:
- **XGBoost/LightGBM** for handling non-linear relationships and feature interactions
- **Neural Networks** for capturing complex patterns in player performance
- **Logistic Regression** as a interpretable baseline

### Features Used for Prediction
- **Player Physical Attributes:** Height, weight, BMI, age, primary position
- **Performance Metrics:** Kicks, handballs, marks, tackles, inside-50s, clearances (historical averages)
- **Contextual Features:** Home/away status, opponent strength, venue, weather conditions
- **Derived Metrics:** Efficiency ratios, form trends (last 5 games), career stage indicators

### Explainability (XAI)
We implement **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to:
- Identify which features most influence each player's goal-scoring probability
- Provide coaches with transparent, interpretable predictions
- Validate or challenge our causal hypotheses
- Generate actionable insights for team selection and opponent analysis

### Model Evaluation
- **Primary Metric:** AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)
- **Secondary Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Log-Loss
- **Validation Strategy:** Time-based split to prevent data leakage (train on 2012-2022, validate on 2023-2025)

## Hypothesis & Research Questions (Causal Analysis)
Our causal inference analysis tested six core hypotheses about factors influencing AFL player performance:

| Hypothesis | Treatment | Effect On | Key Finding |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **H1** | Height | Position-specific outcomes | Rucks (+4.84 HitOuts) - MASSIVE effect; Forwards (-0.31) - negative |
| **H2** | Weight | Clearances, HitOuts | Rucks (+4.69) & Midfield (+0.68) benefit; Forwards/Defenders don't |
| **H3** | BMI | Running vs contest stats | Higher BMI benefits EVERY position - modern game rewards physicality |
| **H4** | is_home | Key outcomes | Only rucks benefit (+0.32 HitOuts) - familiar bounce rhythms matter |
| **H5** | Rule changes | How effects changed over time | 6-6-6 rule made height 9x more valuable (+896%); rotation caps nearly eliminated weight advantage |

## Data Overview

**Source:** [Kaggle 'AFL Stats' Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stoney71/aflstats)
- **players.csv:** Individual players' performance statistics per game (e.g., kicks, handballs, marks, tackles)
- **stats.csv:** Match outcomes, scores, venues, attendance, and team-level statistics

### Data Challenges & Preprocessing
This project involved significant real-world data engineering:
- **Historical Inconsistencies:** Rule changes over decade
- **Entity Resolution:** Team name variations required careful mapping
- **Data Integration:** Joining player-level and match-level data to create unified feature set
